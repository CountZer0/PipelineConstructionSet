        There are two differences between path.write_text() and

          - errors - str - How to handle Unicode encoding errors.
            Default is 'strict'.  See help(unicode.encode) for the
            options.  This is ignored if 'text' isn't a Unicode
            string.
        
          - linesep - keyword argument - str/unicode - The sequence of
            characters to be used to mark end-of-line.  The default is
            os.linesep.  You can also specify None; this means to
            leave all newlines as they are in 'text'.
        
          - append - keyword argument - bool - Specifies what to do if
            the file already exists (True: append to the end of it;
            False: overwrite it.)  The default is False.
        
        
        --- Newline handling.
        
        write_text() converts all standard end-of-line sequences
        ('\n', '\r', and '\r\n') to your platform's default end-of-line
        sequence (see os.linesep; on Windows, for example, the
        end-of-line marker is '\r\n').
        
        If you don't like your platform's default, you can override it
        using the 'linesep=' keyword argument.  If you specifically want
        write_text() to preserve the newlines as-is, use 'linesep=None'.
        
        This applies to Unicode text the same as to 8-bit text, except
        there are three additional standard Unicode end-of-line sequences:
        u'\x85', u'\r\x85', and u'\u2028'.
        
        (This is slightly different from when you open a file for
        writing with fopen(filename, "w") in C or file(filename, 'w')
        in Python.)
        
        
        --- Unicode
        
        If 'text' isn't Unicode, then apart from newline handling, the
        bytes are written verbatim to the file.  The 'encoding' and
        'errors' arguments are not used and must be omitted.
        
        If 'text' is Unicode, it is first converted to bytes using the
        specified 'encoding' (or the default encoding if 'encoding'
        isn't specified).  The 'errors' argument applies only to this
        conversion.
